#+TITLE: UwUnyaa's .emacs

* About this .emacs
This is my config for GNU Emacs. It won't work with GNU Emacs 24 and older
versions. Tables with customized keybindings are [[file:documentation/changed-keybindings.org][here]].

If you want to reuse any of my own code from this repository, feel free to do
it. I'd appreciate comments linking to my repository before function
definitions from here, but they're not necessary. I didn't put any license on
this repository to avoid possible conflicts with extensions.

* Untracked directories for local configuration
I hold my settings specific to my Arch installation in
=~/.emacs.d/config/my-local.el=. You can put your own customizations there if
you want to use my config.

* This config is used on these operating systems:
- [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch GNU/Linux]]
- Android 5.0 with [[https://termux.com/][Termux]] (wasn't tested in a while)
- Multiple versions of Windows (using the native build from the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html#windows][GNU FTP]])
- [[https://www.haiku-os.org/][Haiku]]

* Installation:
On Unix-like operating systems such as GNU/Linux and on Termux:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/UwUnyaa/.emacs.d.git
#+END_EXAMPLE
You can update this config with =git pull=.

You'll need git installed to pull in dependencies with [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]]. Most
packages are pulled straight from the master branch of each repo.

Make sure you don't have a file named =.emacs= in your home directory, because
it overrides =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.

If you are on Windows NT, copy =.emacs.d= to =%appdata%=. You'll need to set
up the =HOME= environment variable on older versions of Windows, and copy this
config there.

The default font is set to [[https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/][DejaVu Sans Mono]], it tends to come with modern
versions of Windows and might be preinstalled in your distro. Emacs should
fall back to something sane, but installing it is highly recommended.

* Structure of directories in this repo
** this directory
- =README.org= :: This file.
- =init.el= :: The first file from this repo that is loaded. It only contains
     code that loads other files. No customizations should go in there.

*** =config=
- =my-defuns.el= :: Definitions of custom functions (in this case ones that
     use default dynamic scoping.)
- =my-defuns-lexical.el= :: Definitions of functions that rely on lexical
     scoping. Mostly functions that generate closures.
- =my-customization.el= :: Contains basic general Emacs customization, and
     customization for modes that come with it out of the box.
- =my-straight-init.el= :: Contains the [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] bootstrap snippet.
- =my-straight-packages.el= :: Defines dependencies of this config.
- =my-extensions.el= :: Customization for added extensions.
- =my-local.el= :: Untracked file for installation-specific settings.

*** =documentation=
This directory contains =.org= files with additional documentation. More files
might be added to it in the future.

- =changed-keybindings.org= :: Tables listing changed keybindings.

*** =snippets=
This directory contains snippets for ~yasnippet~, each major mode gets its own
directory, and file names reflect the key that triggers snippet expansion.

* Information about deprecated parts of this config
Since this configuration is version controlled via [[https://git-scm.com/][git]], you can check out old
commits to see how this repository changed over time as well as seeing parts
of it that were deprecated.

Here are some possibly interesting commits in this repository:
- [[https://github.com/UwUnyaa/.emacs.d/tree/fd2a7db84e315ed3980fe3ce86535e36aa6c7b0a][fd2a7db84e315ed3980fe3ce86535e36aa6c7b0a]] :: the last commit before I moved
     to use =straight.el= as my package manager, contains code that
     automagically sets up =load-path= as well as a simple function to
     generate autoload files.
